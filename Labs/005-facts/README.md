# Lab 005 - Facts

- In this section, we will cover [**Ansible Facts**](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_vars_facts.html#ansible-facts).
- **Ansible facts** are essentially "Ansible Scripts" and constitute one of the building blocks of Ansible.
- **Ansible facts** are data corresponding to your **remote systems**, which includes operating systems, IP addresses, attached filesystems, and more.
- **Ansible facts** are gathered, and relate to target nodes (host nodes to be configured). They are returned back to the controller node.

## 01. **How to View Facts?**
- Ansible gathers facts about remote systems using the `setup` module.
- You can view facts of a remote machine by running the following command:
```bash
ansible all -m setup
```

- Example Output (Truncated for brevity):
  ```json
  {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "ansible_distribution": "Ubuntu",
        "ansible_distribution_version": "22.04",
        "ansible_architecture": "x86_64",
        "ansible_memory_mb": {
            "real": {
                "total": 7989,
                "used": 2034
            }
        },
        "ansible_default_ipv4": {
            "address": "192.168.1.10",
            "netmask": "255.255.255.0",
            "gateway": "192.168.1.1"
        }
    }
  }
  ```

## 02. **How to use facts in playbooks?**

- Facts allow you to base your playbook logic on the properties of the target hosts.
- All facts are prefixed with `ansible_x`.
- For example, to access the operating system distribution of a host, you would use `ansible_distribution`.
- Here are some examples of how to use facts in playbooks:

<br>

#### **Example: Installing Packages Based on OS**

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx on Debian using APT
      ansible.builtin.apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
      when: ansible_distribution == "Ubuntu"

    - name: Install Nginx on RedHat using DNF
      ansible.builtin.dnf:
        name: nginx
        state: present
      when: ansible_distribution == "CentOS"
```

#### **Example: Conditional execution based on memory**

```yaml
- name: Restart Service if Memory is Low
  ansible.builtin.service:
    name: my_service
    state: restarted
  when: ansible_memory_mb.real.total < 4000
```

## 03. **Commonly used facts**

## 04. **Disabling fact gathering**

- By default, Ansible gathers facts before running a playbook. 
- In order to disable it, add the following at the beginning of your playbook:
- To disable fact gathering, set `gather_facts` to `no` in your playbook:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: Print a message
      debug:
        msg: "Facts gathering is disabled!"
```

---

## 05. **Custom Facts**

* You can define custom facts by creating `.fact` files, placing them inside `/etc/ansible/facts.d/` directory on the managed host.

#### **Example: Creating a custom fact**

* Create the file `/etc/ansible/facts.d/custom.fact` with:

    ```ini
    [custom]
    environment=production
    app_version=1.2.3
    ```

* Retrieve the fact in a playbook:

    ```yaml
    - hosts: all
      tasks:
        - debug:
            msg: "App version is {{ ansible_local.custom.app_version }}"
    ```

#### **Using Custom Facts**

- Another way to define your own custom facts using the `set_fact` module in your playbooks.
- Here is an example:

    ```yaml
    - hosts: all
      tasks:
        - name: Set custom fact
          ansible.builtin.set_fact:
            my_custom_fact: "Hello, Ansible!"
        - name: Print custom fact
          debug:
            msg: "{{ my_custom_fact }}"
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>

    ```yaml
    ---
    - hosts: all
      tasks:
        - name: Restart service if memory low

    <details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>

    First, create `/etc/ansible/facts.d/custom.fact` on the host:

    ```ini
    [custom]
    environment=development
    ```

    Then playbook:

    ```yaml
    ---

    <summary>Solution</summary>

    ```yaml
    ---
    - hosts: all
      tasks:
        - name: Print hostname
          debug:
            msg: "Hostname: {{ ansible_hostname }}"
    ```
    </details>

* Create a playbook that checks the OS family and installs a package accordingly (e.g., `nginx` for `Debian`, `httpd` for `RedHat`).

    <summary>Solution</summary>

    ```yaml
    ---
    - hosts: all
      tasks:

## 07. **Summary**

🔹 Ansible **facts** provide system details dynamically.  
🔹 They are automatically gathered using the `setup` module.  
🔹 They are useful for **conditional logic** in playbooks.  
🔹 Facts may include **OS, networking, CPU, memory and more**.  
🔹 Custom facts can be created for **customized automation**.
