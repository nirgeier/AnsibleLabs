- The lab contains a `docker-compose` file alongside a Dockerfile.
- The containers are based on Ubuntu OS and are published on `DockerHub` as well.
- Build the demo containers by running:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
- The docker-compose will create `ansible-controller` which will server as our controller to execute ansible playbooks on our demo servers defined by the names `linux-server-X`

* The shared folder(s) will be mounted into the containers
* The containers will have access to the shared folder(s) for reading and writing files
* The shared folder(s) will be used to store the Ansible playbooks and inventory files
* The shared folder(s) will be mounted at `/labs-scripts` in the containers
